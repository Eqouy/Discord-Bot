# Discord-Bot
Source code for a bot I coded in JavaScript.


This is practically a template for a simple bot to use with some features:

Features
-------------
!hello - replies with "Hello there, (username)
!sysinfo - replies with the name of the bot
!say (message) - replies with whatever you wanted to say 
!delete (not working currently) - would delete a certain amount of messages if it currently worked


Installation Steps
--------------------
1. Install node.js from: www.nodejs.org
2. Install discord.js by typing to a console "npm install --save discord.js"
3. Add the token for your bot into the code, you can also edit the lines, 23, 28, 32, 34, 37, 43, 48



Running the bot.
-------------------
*FOLLOW ON WINDOWS* 
1. Open the .bat file to start bot (Windows)

*IF YOU ARE ON MAC FOLLOW THESE ADDITIONAL STEPS*
1. Instead of using the .bat file, you will be using the runbot.command file.
2. First go into a console and cd to the directory of the .command file.
3. Then into the console type, "chmod +x runbot.command"
4. Then run the file.
*ALL YOU DID WAS MAKE IN AN EXECUTABLE FILE*
