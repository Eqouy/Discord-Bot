Source code for a bot I coded in JavaScript.

1. Install node.js from: www.nodejs.org

Running the bot.
-------------------
*FOLLOW ON WINDOWS* 
1. Open the .bat file to start bot (Windows)

*IF YOU ARE ON MAC FOLLOW THESE ADDITIONAL STEPS*
1. Instead of using the .bat file, you will be using the runbot.command file.
2. First go into a console and cd to the directory of the .command file.
3. Then into the console type, "chmod +x runbot.command"
4. Then run the file.
*ALL YOU DID WAS MAKE IN AN EXECUTABLE FILE*
