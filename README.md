[ATTENTION!]
I stopped coding this bot a while back, but I would be happy to update and add more features to anyone's liking

# Discord-Bot
Source code for a bot I coded in JavaScript.


This is practically a template for a simple bot to use with some features:

Features
-------------
1. !commands - lists commands
2. !ping - replies with pong
3. !8ball [question] - you ask a question and the bot selects a random answer, then it replies with the answer
4. !noticeme - replies to you 
5. !embed


Installation Steps
--------------------
1. Install node.js from: www.nodejs.org
2. Install discord.js by typing to a console "npm install --save discord.js"
3. Add the token for your bot into the code. Edit the other lines to fit your server, or bot name. MAKE SURE TO EDIT WELCOME MESSAGES, AND EMBEDS!



Running the bot.
-------------------
1. Open the .bat file to start bot.
